      <h2> About this Application </h2>
      TA Hours queue is a database backed web application that tracks teaching hours sessions. Its primary function is to give students and teaching assistants a responsive queue that makes tracking information easier. It also allows the queue to be on the web, which makes it easily accessible (rather than a physical queue on a board in some random classroom). It can also be used to perform data analysis on the data held within the databases, which can give key statistics for funding and educational purposes. 
      <h2> About this Project </h2>
      This application was created as part of a special studies project by the author in her final semester of her undergraduate career. It was built to tackle some of the issues she saw as a teaching assistant. For more information on this project, see its <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyxiao/ta-hours-queue">github repository</a>
      <h2> About the Author </h2>
      At the time of the creation of this application, Tiffany Xiao was a 2020J senior double majoring in Computer Science and Statistical & Data Sciences. Her hope is that someone will find this project helpful and make helping others in computer science a little easier. She is from Brooklyn, New York and loves her puppy named Tofu.
